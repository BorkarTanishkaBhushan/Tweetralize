Generally speaking, social media sites have access to a lot of our personal data that is kept on centralised servers that are vulnerable to security risks. Additionally, the consumer is given less transparency and control. The application's controller has the discretion to suspend his or her account. Taking into account the give problem statement, create a decentralised platform that enables people to express their thoughts and emotions online.


# Application Requirements:-
1.The user of the programme should be able to upload any type of content, including text, photos, videos, and other types of media.
2.Take into account many aspects, such as offensive language and other content.
3.The programme should have a decentralised structure.
4.Different users should be able to view the uploaded content of other users.


## What does a decentralized tweeting system do ?
A decentralised tweeting system is a social media platform where data is stored and maintained over a network of distributed nodes rather than being under the control of a single entity. Because of this, users have more privacy and security because neither a centralised organisation nor authority can control what is posted or how it is delivered. The tweets are kept on a blockchain, which promotes greater transparency and prevents any single person from censoring or manipulating the data.
Compared to centralised ones, decentralised tweeting systems can offer a variety of advantages, such as:
1. Decentralization: It reduces the possibility of censorship, data breaches, and manipulation because there is no single organisation in charge.
2. Privacy: Compared to centralised systems, users have more discretion over who gets access to their data and how it is used.
3. Transparency: A public blockchain keeps track of all transactions and interactions, giving a tamper-proof, transparent record of every action.
4. Ownership: Rather than having their data controlled and sold by a centralised corporation, users retain ownership of their data and are free to decide whether to monetize or sell it.
5. Community-driven: Rather than a single firm, a community of users often runs and maintains decentralised systems, which might result in a more user-driven development process.
Inshort, Decentralized tweeting platforms often strive to offer a more private, secure, and open substitute for centralised social media platforms.


## Tech Stack
**Client:** Next Js , TailwindCSS , Javascript
**Server:** solidity  , Node Js
**tools:** Hardhat , Metamask
**Reasons we are using the following tech stack :
Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides a set of features for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance. Next.js allows developers to perform server-side rendering out of the box, there are more to add


## Challenges faced in decentralised tweeting system:
There are several challenges faced in implementing a decentralized tweeting system:
Scalability: Decentralized systems often struggle to scale to handle large numbers of users and high volumes of transactions.

Security: Decentralized systems must ensure the security of user data and prevent malicious actors from manipulating the system or stealing data.

Interoperability: A decentralized tweeting system must be able to interact with other decentralized systems, such as blockchain networks, to ensure seamless integration.

Privacy: A decentralized tweeting system must provide robust privacy controls to protect user data and ensure that users have control over their data.

Usability: Decentralized systems can often be complex and difficult to use, which may limit their adoption by mainstream users.

Governance: Decentralized systems must have clear governance mechanisms in place to ensure that the system is maintained and updated over time.

Network Effect: Decentralized systems must overcome the network effect challenge, where the value of the system increases as more users join, in order to become widely adopted.

Regulation: Decentralized systems may face regulatory challenges, as governments seek to regulate and control these systems to protect their citizens and prevent illegal activity.


##Features that can be added in future in decentralised tweeting system: 
Here are some features that could be added in the future to a decentralized tweeting system:
Advanced Privacy Controls: Additional privacy controls, such as end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages, could be added to enhance the privacy of users.

Decentralized File Storage: A decentralized file storage system, such as IPFS, could be integrated to allow users to store and share media files in a decentralized manner.

Token-based Rewards System: A token-based rewards system could be implemented to incentivize users to contribute to the network, such as through the creation of high-quality content or moderation activities.

Decentralized Identity: A decentralized identity system, such as a blockchain-based identity management system, could be integrated to allow users to securely and privately manage their identity information.

Decentralized Advertising: A decentralized advertising platform could be implemented to allow users to earn revenue from their content while preserving their privacy.

Decentralized Moderation: A decentralized moderation system could be implemented to allow users to collectively govern and enforce community standards and policies.

Interoperability with Other Decentralized Systems: The system could be designed to be interoperable with other decentralized systems, such as blockchain networks, to allow for seamless integration and increased utility.

Machine Learning and AI: Advanced machine learning and AI algorithms could be integrated to improve the quality of recommendations, moderation, and content discovery.
